Compiled kernel features
------------------------

You do not need to do the below steps for Debian 6

In order to use nDPI as a kernel module notice that:

- You should ENABLE Netfilter conntrack events (and also enable Advanced
  netfilter features to see it).

In kernel 2.6.34 its defined as:

Connection tracking events
Symbol: NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS
Location:
-> Networking support
 -> Networking options
  -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)
   -> Core Netfilter Configuration
    -> Netfilter connection tracking support

- If your kernel version is 2.6.31 or greater, then you should DISABLE
  Netfilter conntrack for the Netlink protocol.

In kernel 2.6.34 its defined as:

Connection tracking netlink interface
Symbol: NF_CT_NETLINK
Location:
-> Networking support
 -> Networking options
  -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)
   -> Core Netfilter Configuration
